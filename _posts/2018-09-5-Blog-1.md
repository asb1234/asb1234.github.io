    <td>I often bugged my friends for help and they bugged me back . I was  not very good the first time I tried creating a blog I deleted the first two i created as they had a lot of issues and what not. The fact that it was the first day of school i wasn't very enthusiastic so i did not work very fast and i feel i didn't put my all in.</td>
